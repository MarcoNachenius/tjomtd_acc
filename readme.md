# TjomTD

## Overview

TjomTD is a maze tower defense game where you strategically build a maze with towers and barricades to fend off waves of creeps. Each round, you’ll choose from randomly generated towers to shape the path and defend your base.

## Game Rules

- **Maze Building**: Each round, you're given 5 random towers to choose from, and you get to decide where to place each one as long as it does not block the creeps' path completely.
- **Tower Selection**: Choose one tower to place; the other four become barricades.
- **Barricades**: Only barricades can be removed, not placed towers. Towers can be upgraded and may become barricades at a later stage.
- **Creep Pathing**:
