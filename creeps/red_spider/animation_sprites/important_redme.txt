Important Note on Sprite Naming Conventions Mistake
===================================================
The naming conventions for the compass direction suffixes for this creep's animated sprites are incorrectly named in the png files.

For instance, the file named `move_n.png` should be named `move_nw.png`.

Please ensure to rename the files accordingly to maintain consistency and avoid any confusion during the animation handling process.
